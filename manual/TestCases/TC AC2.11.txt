TC AC2.11

Description:
Using a shortcut while a date selection is active sets start and end dates correctly for Created on - "Last 90 days"

Precondition: Make sure you have:
1 - TopicA created tomorrow (force it in db or with API if possible)
2 - TopicB created today
3 - TopicC created before yesterday and after 90 days in the past (so that it does not collide with step 3)
4 - TopicD created exactly on the 90th day in the past
5 - TopicE created exactly on the 91st day in the past

Steps:
1. Login to the application
2. Navigate to "Topic Hub"
3. Create a filter for "Created on" from today to yesterday
	-> TopicB is displayed
4. Reopen the filter for "Created on"
5. And select "Last 90 days" shortcut

Expected:
1. Dates are displayed correctly when reopening filter (today -> today - 90 days)
2. TopicB, TopicC, and TopicD is displayed
